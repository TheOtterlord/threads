# Threads

A hacked together js client for [Threads](https://threads.net/). I can't promise anything will work, as this is purely built from reverse-engineering their minimal web app. A single update on their end could break everything, so don't use this for anything serious. This is all for fun & games.

## Install

```sh
npm install meta-threads
```
